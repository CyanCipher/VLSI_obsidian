Event-driven simulation (EDS) is a type of simulation that models the behavior of a system as a sequence of events. Events represent changes in the state of the system. For example, in a simulation of a computer network, events might include packets being sent and received, nodes being added and removed, and links failing and recovering.

EDS works by maintaining a queue of upcoming events. The simulator starts by executing the first event in the queue. This event may cause other events to be scheduled, which are added to the queue. The simulator then executes the next event in the queue, and so on. This process continues until there are no more events in the queue or until the simulation is stopped.

EDS has a number of advantages over other types of simulation, such as time-driven simulation. First, EDS is more efficient, because it only simulates the parts of the system that are affected by an event. Second, EDS is more flexible, because it can be used to model systems with complex timing behavior.

EDS is used in a wide variety of applications, including:

- Computer network simulation
- Hardware design verification
- Software testing
- Financial modeling
- Manufacturing simulation

Here is an example of a simple EDS model of a computer network:

```
# Event queue
event_queue = []

# Schedule an event to send a packet from node A to node B
event_queue.append(Event(type="SEND_PACKET", source="A", destination="B"))

# Start the simulation
while event_queue:
    event = event_queue.pop(0)

    # Execute the event
    event.execute()

    # Schedule any new events that are caused by this event
    for new_event in event.get_new_events():
        event_queue.append(new_event)
```

This model will simulate the sending of a packet from node A to node B. When the `SEND_PACKET` event is executed, it will create a new event to represent the receipt of the packet at node B. This new event will be added to the event queue, and it will be executed at the appropriate time.

EDS is a powerful tool for simulating the behavior of complex systems. It is used in a wide variety of applications, and it is an essential tool for engineers and scientists who design, develop, and test complex systems.
