In VHDL, processes are used to describe the sequential behavior of a design. Processes are declared using the `process` keyword, followed by a sensitivity list and a sequence of statements. The sensitivity list is a list of signals that the process is sensitive to. The process is executed whenever any of the signals in the sensitivity list changes.

The sequence of statements in a process is executed sequentially, one statement at a time. The statements can be any valid VHDL statements, such as signal assignments, conditional statements, and loops.

Processes can also contain wait statements. Wait statements suspend the execution of the process until a certain condition is met. This can be used to implement synchronization between different processes or to delay the execution of a process.

Here is an example of a simple process:

VHDL

```
process (input)
begin
  output <= not input;
end process;
```

This process inverts the input signal and assigns the result to the output signal. The process is sensitive to the `input` signal, so it is executed whenever the `input` signal changes.

Processes are a powerful tool for describing the sequential behavior of a design. They can be used to implement a wide variety of functionality, such as state machines, counters, and arithmetic circuits.

Here are some of the benefits of using processes:

- **Modularity:** Processes can be used to create modular designs that can be reused and integrated with other designs.
- **Abstraction:** Processes allow designers to abstract away the implementation details of a design, making it easier to understand and use.
- **Testability:** Processes make it easier to test designs, because the behavior of a process can be easily isolated from the rest of the design.

Overall, processes are an important part of VHDL design. They allow designers to create modular, abstract, and testable designs.
